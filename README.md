This project provides tools for working with JSON values using [circe][circe] and
[Monocle][monocle]. It was included in the main circe repository until the 0.10.0 release, when
it was promoted to its own project in order to decouple its releases (and the Scala versions it
is cross-published for) from the main circe modules.
